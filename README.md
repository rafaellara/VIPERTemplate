# VIPERTemplate
My interpretation of the VIPER architecture for iOS with a Template

This is a template for Xcode. Adding it to the system, when selected, it will generate all the components, given the component name:
- `Wireframe`
- `ViewItem`
- `ViewProtocol`
- `PresenterProtocol`
- `Presenter`
- `InteractorProtocol`
- `Interactor`
- `ServiceProtocol`
- `Service`
- `Entity`

# How can install the files?

- Check out this template.
- Open the templates folder in Finder (`/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/`)
- Create a new folder in it (I've called Patterns, but you can name it as you want. It will serve as the section name).
- In it, copy the VIPER.xctemplate
- Now, everytime you create a new file in Xcode, it will offer the option to generate the whole set of the VIPER architecture for you.
